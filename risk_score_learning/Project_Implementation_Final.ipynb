    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 Pandemic, contact tracing came to the forefront of digital tools to help combat the spread of the virus. Part of the work in contact tracing is to accurately determine the risk of infection of an individual given their exposure to other individuals who have tested positive, so as to alert the individual should the risk be significant. This paper aims to solve the problem of accurately determining the probability of infection based on features of interpersonal interactions (e.g. duration and distance of interaction) and the contagiousness of the infected case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly important since contact tracing is a key tool used by many places to contain the spread of the virus. When an individual is alerted of their risk of infection in a timely manner, they can be advised to isolate and thereby reduce the chances of them spreading the virus to other people should they be infected. Hence, accurately determining the risk of infection and using the information to advise individuals of relevant protocols can determine the efficacy of contact tracing as a tool, and more seriously, the extent of virus and pandemic progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Literature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Return to top](#Notebook-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper references a few examples of work that has been done in contact tracing, and specifically in using data to train models for risk scoring. First, the paper centers on the risk score model for the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) system [1] for contact tracing, which has predefined relationships of specified parameters that come from data which can be collected through mobile applications. The associated parameters are the main focus of the machine learning optimization problem covered in the paper, and that we hope to recreate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the paper highlights that many current risk score models or contact tracing apps assume a known model with fixed parameters. There is a publicly available resource put together by domain experts that suggest values for the parameters. [2] A couple of other papers cited also evaluate the effectiveness of contact tracing apps that assume a fixed, known model. [3,4] The authors find this landscape to present a gap in that these models are not dynamic or flexible enough to adjust to or reflect what the data might tell us. Having fixed parameters beforehand without accounting for what is happening in real life (as seen from data), even if they were determined through expert guidance, may still be biased or inaccurate. Hence, they suggest that their own model of training to fit data could perform better at estimating an individual's risk of infection, and compare their results to that of a Swiss model that uses fixed thresholds. [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, they acknowledge one paper that attempts to use data to train a model that optimizes for the risk parameters. [6] However, there were two gaps: (1) this earlier paper did not account for the infectiousness of the index case; and (2) this earlier paper performed supervised learning. For the first gap, by not accounting for the infectiousness, the model is potentially missing out on additional useful data that could inform the risk score, since the infectiousness of a patient you come across could greatly affect whether or not you would catch the virus from them. Moreover, the infectiousness is data that is captured by the GAEN app, so having a model that can utilize all the relevant data points collected by the app can maximize its efficacy and allow the model to be deployed directly. The second gap relates to the real-life applicability of the model. This current paper suggests that they have a better solution since their model takes into account imperfect information, for example, by not having complete infection labels for every single exposure, but an overall label for a bag of exposures that is prone to false negatives because of censoring. This is also potentially more realistic in a real-life situation where information collection is likely imperfect."

    "Due to privacy issues, the authors of the paper could not access real data collected by the covid tracing app. Therefore, the first contribution they made was to propose a mechanism to generate synthetic data, which we will provide detailed documentation of in II.2. Since the focus of our project is on understanding and testing their model for learning risk score parameters, we have decided to use the same synthetic data generator to replicate and test the experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, with a dataset in hand, the authors performed several comparative experiments to prove that their algorithm is effective in estimating parameters of risk score models. They do this by doing a semi-supervised machine learning, where observations are clustered or \"bagged\" and their labels are aggregated (and in some cases, partially censored). The observation features are then fed into a machine learning model for the model to learn to predict risk scores that will maximize the log-likelihood of the corresponding bag labels. Producing risk score estimations involves optimizing for parameters such as attenuation thresholds and weights and contagiousness weights, which was performed using the `jax` package implementation of stochastic gradient descent.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data generation is not the main objective of this project, it is worth pointing out that the authors have done a tremendous job putting together a sensible physical model using scientific literature, and coming up with approximation tools to simulate the real life scenario, i.e. the transmission mechanism of COVID-19. We will elaborate on how the transmission is modelled in the physical world and analogous features collected on the mobile application, since this is what defines the generative model and is thus used to inform the eventual optimization.\n",

    "A bottom-up approach can be used to describe the transmission mechanism.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a person is exposed to another person who has been infected. The hazard score of that event is defined to be a function of three arguments: duration of exposure $\\tau_n$, the distance of exposure $d_n$, and the time of sympton onset since the exposure $\\sigma_n$ (of the infected person), which is a proxy for the infectiousness of the index case. Namely, \n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\phi$ are parameters of the simulator. Notice the exact functional form of $f_{dist}$ and $f_{inf}$ follow fluid physics law as well as empirical conventions[1,2], which we choose not to write in details here given this is not our core implementation and innovation. \n",

    "Since all training features (essentially the model inputs) will be recorded by a mobile device, the data generator is modelled after the device used for recording. For this paper, the authors decide to follow the GAEN system as mentioned above in the Introduction. Specifically, the distance function $f_{dist}$ is approximated by bluetooth attentuation $f_{ble}$, and the infectiousness calculation function $f_{inf}$ is approximated by a quantized version of symptom onset time $f_{con}$. Rewriting equation (1) from above, we get the risk score model:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The bluetooth attenuation function assigns different weights to different attenuation thresholds, and all the weights and thresholds are parameters to optimize for. To put it simply, the farther apart the devices, the less weight the attenuation function assigns. The actual math shows a relationship that maps bluetooth attenuation ($a_n$) to 4 categories defined by 3 attentuation threshold angles, $\\theta_b^\\text{ble}$ (distance), with each category having an output of one weight. \n",

    "\n",
    "Two modifications to this mapping function that is relevant for our work is (1) the assumption of monotocity of the weights; and (2) transforming this discretized categorization into a continuous function. These two modifications directly influence our mathematical work and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Assumption of Monotonicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically, it is reasonable to believe that the risk of infection only gets higher when the distance between an individual and infected case gets closer. Hence, to ensure this monotonic relationship is followed in the computational model, the authors opted to reparameterize the weights as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w^{\\text{ble}} = [w_1^{\\text{ble}}, w_2^{\\text{ble}} = w_1^{\\text{ble}} + \\Delta_2^{\\text{ble}}, w_3^{\\text{ble}} = w_2^{\\text{ble}} + \\Delta_3^{\\text{ble}}, w_4^{\\text{ble}} = w_3^{\\text{ble}} + \\Delta_4^{\\text{ble}}]$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Hence, we will optimize over $(w^{\\text{ble}}_1, \\Delta_2^{\\text{ble}},\\Delta_3^{\\text{ble}},\\Delta_4^{\\text{ble}})$ instead of $(w_1^{\\text{ble}}, w_2^{\\text{ble}}, w_3^{\\text{ble}}, w_4^{\\text{ble}})$. We will have a function that maps the weights to the parameters we optimize, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Discrete to continuous mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach as represented by the function right now is known as hard binning. However, this means that the function is not continuous with respects to the attenuation thresholds. The motivation to ensure the function is continuous with respects to the thresholds is so that the function can be easily differentiated with respects to the thresholds and thus the gradient can be easily calculated too. Hence, the authors opted to replace this hard binning method with a soft thresholding approximation, by converting the discrete mapping to one that utilizes the sigmoid function, $\\sigma_\\tau$. In the equations below, $I \\left(\\theta^{\\text{ble}}_{b-1} < a_{nk} \\leq \\theta^{\\text{ble}}_{b}\\right)$ represents the output from the discrete function presented above.\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### **Contagiousness of Index Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "The days since symptom onset is calculated by health authorities and directly mapped to 3 contagiousness levels: none ($c_n = 1$), standard ($c_n = 2$), and high ($c_n = 3$). The eventual contagiousness level is then used in the risk scoring instead of having the calculated days be directly accessible by Google/Apple in view of privacy concerns. Again, zero weight is assigned to the none level, and two non-zero weights are assigned to the other two levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f_{\\text{con}}(c_n; \\psi)=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "          0 \\quad &\\text{if} \\, c_n = 1 \\\\\n",

    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there is an assumption of monotonicity that is used to reparameterize the weights because there is a biological basis for believing that the risk of infection will only increase with increasing contagiousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w^{\\text{con}} = [w_2^{\\text{con}}, w_2^{\\text{con}} + \\Delta^\\text{con}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will optimize over $(w_2^{\\text{con}}, \\Delta^\\text{con})$ and similarly have a function that maps between these parameters and the weights in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### **Mapping Risk Score to Probability of Infection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to map the risk score into probability space, which is constrained to the bounds $[0,1]$, the authors use the standard exponential does response model [3]. Below is the form that uses the risk score model (instead of the hazard score model), which takes into account the digital features collected to determine the estimated probability of infection. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_n = \\mathbb{P}(y_n = 1|\\tilde x_n; \\psi) = 1 - e^{-\\mu r_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\tilde x_n = (\\tau_n, a_n, c_n)$, $y_n = 1$ (infected) or $0$ (not infected).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1.3 Multiple exposures**\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extension of the individual exposure modelling described above, the authors look at combining the risk from multiple exposures to reflect a single individual's experience, First, the authors recognize that different exposure events means different lengths of time spent in different distances to infected cases. This is represented by calculating the amount of time spent in each attenuation bucket (which is then transformed to the continuous sigmoid):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{\\tau_{n b}}_{\\text{duration in bucket } b}= \\sum_{k=1}^{K_{n}} \\underbrace{\\tau_{n k}}_{\\text {duration}} \\times \\underbrace{\\mathbb{I}\\left(\\theta_{b-1}^{\\text {ble }}< a_{nk} \\leq \\theta_{b}^{\\text {ble}}\\right)}_{\\text{attenuation is in bucket } b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K_n$ is the number of exposures within the n'th exposure window. We then are able to compute the overall risk for the exposure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{r_{n}}_{\\text {risk score }}=\\underbrace{\\left[\\sum_{b=1}^{N_{B}} \\tau_{n b} w_{b}^{\\text {ble }}\\right]}_{\\text {weighted exposure minutes }} \\times \\underbrace{\\left[\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N_{C}} \\mathbb{I}\\left(c_{n, \\ell}\\right) w_{\\ell}^{\\text {con }}\\right]}_{\\text {weighted contagiousness level }}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have multiple exposures for a user, we sum the risk scores to get $R_j = \\sum_{n \\in E_j} r_n$, which then translates into an overall probability of infection:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_j = 1 - e^{-\\mu \\cdot R_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1.4 Bagging of exposure observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual exposure events are first randomly generated. Then, the exposure events are randomly grouped or bagged to represent the experience of an individual, and the probability of infection is calculated using the above aggregation. Each exposure event can affect multiple individuals, in a concept coined as the social network effect in the paper. However, this is not crucial to our calculations since it is taken care of in the bagging step of the model instead of in optimization. The probability of infection is then used to generate the ground truth label of whether a person is infected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having generated the data, the authors attempt to simulate the situation on the other side, which is in receiving the data and optimizing a model for the parameters. The same model is assumed for optimization, and the bagging of exposure events as described in the section above adds complexity in terms of noise and the potential for \"censoring\", where determinative exposure events (when an exposure significantly contributes to a person's risk but is not recorded) is not captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Machine learning technique used\n",
    "\n",
    " + Multi-instance learning, Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is dealing with a multi-instance (MI) learning problem, which belongs to supervised learning. Where MI learning differs from the traditional scenario is in the nature of the learning examples. In MI learning each example is represented by a bag of feature vectors. Classification labels are only provided for entire bags, and the task is to learn a model that predicts the classification labels for unseen future bags. In our case, we have only one, binary label (a user gets infected or not) for a \"bag\" of exposure events. Potentially this type of problem gets more challenging to tackle as the bag getting larger or the feature in the bag is noisy, which correspond to more exposures and censoring recorded on the app. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we have ten parameters of the infectious risk model to learn. To recap, two weights parameters $(\\Delta_{2:3}^{\\text{con}})$ come from the contageousness measure; three threshold angles $(\\theta_{1:3}^{\\text{ble}})$ and four weights $(w_1^{\\text{ble}} \\text{and} \\Delta_{2:4}^{\\text{ble}})$ from bluetooth attentuation; and $\\mu$, a constant in the exponential model. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood (or minimizing the binary cross entropy) of th e following fuction, where $Q_j$ incorporates these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\psi) = -\\sum_{j=1}^J Y_j \\log Q_j + (1-Y_j)\\log (1-Q_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the infection label for user $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact techniques used by original authors are not complicated though, since relatively simple algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proven the effectivness through their experiments. Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm, that starts from a random point on a function and travels down its slope in steps until it reaches the optimal point of function. Adding stochastic component can let the gradient descent to start at random point for each iteration. Some biggest advantages are to reduce the computations enormously and to avoid the algorithm stuck at undesired optima. However, we need to be careful on choosing a proper learning rate, as SGD is sensitive to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original experiment, the authors fit the model using 1000 iterations with batch size of 100. After the fitting, they choose AUC as metrics to discusses the performance with increasing problem complexity. \n"

Again, we first define some helper functions such as loss function, conversion of parameters (for reparameterization), initialization of weights and unpacking them, etc. Next, we train the model using stochastic gradient descent code from class. Finally, we combine everything together with the bagging simulator above, such that the function will take in an instance of a bagging simulator class, and run the necessary steps for the inputs to be bagged and used in training."

    "⛔ PLEASE DO NOT RERUN THE EXPERIMENT PART SINCE IT TAKES EXTREMELY LONG TIME\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few experiments were performed around tweaking different features of the data to check that the parameter learning model is behaving as we expect it to. These experiments were geared towards an outcome-based focus (such that we want to see the outputs and use the expected trend of the output as a proxy for the \"correctness\" of the model), rather than a specific mechanics correctness check. The authors also compared the outcomes to the performance of a ground truth model (\"True\", in subsequent plots) and that of the Swiss model with fixed parameters. We decided to focus our efforts on comparing it to the ground truth to elucidate its general performance trends, since the Swiss model is not our focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of the experiments and a brief summary of the results are listed below. Specific elaboration of each experiment follows in the respective subsections for the experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maximum bag sizes were varied, while holding other parameters constant.** In particular, while the maximum bag size can go up to 32, the maximum number of positive exposures per bag remains fixed at 1.\n",
    "2. **Censoring probability is varied, while holding other parameters constant.** Censoring probability refers to the chances of an exposure not being recorded and thus not being a part of the data. We test this with different censor probabilities, for fixed maximum bag sizes of 16 and 32, with a maximum of 1 positive exposure per bag.\n",
    "3. **Varying positive bag construction, with varied maximum bag sizes.** The maximum number of positive exposures per bag can now go up to 3, while maximum bag sizes increases up to 32.\n",
    "4. **Robustness to model mismatch.** Since we are working with simulated data, there is a probability that the simulated data is not reflective of the real world, and that data in the real world is much less precise. Hence, the original generative model is approximated and the resulting dataset tested on to see the performance of the current learning model to potentially different generative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we ran one of our own experiments just as corroboration to make sure that the learning model is not training or fitting specifically to a specific order of the data, again as a check for the robustness of the model in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reordering of data in training.** Training data is reordered so the model will learn parameters on different sequences of data points each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all experiments, the metric used in the paper and which we are emulating is the AUC score. A higher AUC score reflects higher accuracy of the model in predicting the parameters that will generate a risk score which gives the maximum log-likelihood for the infection observation. Since we are using our own basic python code for the training, we do not have the efficiency gains of an ML package like `jax`. Hence, our code takes a very long while to run (about 20 minutes for 1 trial with 5 random starting points) and we were unable to run it multiple times to get replicates. Instead, we were only able to initialize the algorithm from 5 different starting points and plotted the results from the best output."

    "\n",
    "[Return to top](#Notebook-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment is iterated over increasing bag sizes to show the effect that increasing bag size has on the performance of the learning algorithm. Increasing bag size would increase uncertainty in assigning a risk score, since there is more noise with more observations, while the maximum number of positive exposures in the bag still remains fixed at 1. Hence, the signal of the one positive exposure (if it exists) gets drowned out as bag size increases, and it is harder to push the algorithm to an optimum which captures these signals well. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the performance of the algorithm to decrease, i.e. the AUC score to fall, as bag size increases. This is reflected in the two plots below, where the AUC drops from a high of around 0.9 to plateau arounnd 0.7. We also note that the performance of the learning algorithm is worse than that of the true parameters, which is to be expected. Overall, the trends for this experiment definitely supports the claim being made."

    "### 2. Varying censoring probability\n",
    "\n",
    "[Return to top](#Notebook-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment is iterated over censoring probabilities to show the effect that increasing censoring probability has on the performance of the learning algorithm. Increasing censoring probability would reduce accuracy in assigning a risk score, since there is less signal when some positive exposures are censored or not taken into account in learning the model. With less data, the algorithm will definitely be biased against calculating a higher risk score. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the performance of the algorithm to decrease, i.e. the AUC score to fall, as censoring probability increases. This is reflected in the below too sets of experiments. When we set the maximum bag size to be 16, two plots shows that the AUC drops from a high of around 0.8 to less than 0.6. We even try a differnt maximum bag size (32) to cross check, and again the AUC drops from 0.8 - 0.55. Overall, the trends for this experiment supports the claim being made, although it definitely begs the question of what is the point of making this claim and experiment, knowing that this is a fundamental design flaw that may not be helpful to pandemic efforts (e.g. being more cautious and compensating for potentially censored exposures, instead of just recognizing and accepting that the prediction and risk scoring will drop). A discussion on this is expounded on in part III.1, Evaluation."

    "### 3. Varying Positive Bag Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Return to top](#Notebook-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment first increases the maximum number of positive exposures per bag from 1 to 3, then iterates over increasing bag sizes. We want to compare the results here to that of Experiment 1., to show the effect that increasing maximum number of positive exposures has on the performance of the learning algorithm. Increasing maximum number of positive exposures would increase the signal received by the algorithm. Hence, the algorithm should perform better as long as the gain in signal (compared to experiment 1) is not outweighed by the gain in noise from increasing bag size. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the performance of the algorithm to increase, i.e. the AUC score to increase, compared to experiment 1. However, this will only happen for maximum bag sizes up till around 3 or 4, and will decrease after. This is reflected in the two plots below, where the AUC increases slightly (from around 0.8 to 0.9) up until a maximum bag size of 4, then drops. This trend supports the claim being made, since having up to 3 positive exposures in a bag is significant when the number of positive exposures make up a substantial percentage of the bag size. In this case, a maximum of 3 positive exposures in a bag of 4 exposures would mean a signal strength of 75%. However as the bag gets larger but the positive exposures remain at a fixed maximum of 3, it faces the same problem as Experiment 1 where the noise of the additional exposures drown out the signal. "

    "### 4. Robustness to Model Mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "[Return to top](#Notebook-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing that the simulator may not be completely accurate or reflective of real data, slightly modifying the simulator by using a Taylor series approximation and then testing the performance of the model to see its robustness to slightly different generating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment is iterated over decreasing number of Taylor approximation terms to show the effect that increasing model mismatch has on the performance of the learning algorithm. Decreasing the number of terms used in the Taylor approximation of the generative function that directly calculates the probability of infection would increase model mismatch in that the approximation becomes less accurate to the original function. Hence, the probability of infection calculated should be less accurate as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the performance of the algorithm to decrease, i.e. the AUC score to fall, as model mismatch increases, or as the number of Taylor approximation terms decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "This generic trend has been illustrated through the below two graphs. Reading from left to right following the x-axis (number of taylor terms increases), we do see a increase of AUC for the training set and testing sets. We can see they matche our expectation. However, for both sets the accuracy for using Inf terms (10 terms) is not clear that the infinity approximation seems to be less accurate than using less term. This phenomenon suggests two possibilities. First, our simulator may not be a very accruate model of how COVID is tranmitted, so that mismatch phenomenon is reflected not so completely. Second, our version of simulator is in general a robust one but with some noise. "

We would expect the same trends as Experiment 1, and it acts more like a check to make sure that the learning model previously was not learning to a very specific sequence of the data and being biased. This is confirmed by two graphs below, where we can see the decreasing AUC following the increase of bag size. \n",

    "\n",
    "Here we test out two scenarios of \"failure\". First is using a large learning rate in the traning process. The learning rate problem is briefly mentioned in II.2.2 when we introduce SGD alogirthm that SGD is sensitive to the learning rate. We show that if the learning rate is large (0.1 vs 0.001 original), the algorithm could not converge to a descent accuracy. Compared to original implementation, the accuracy is only 0.5 for training and 0.17 for testing, where the original hits 0.87 for both traning and testing, with truth being 0.9. The large learning rate is thus considered an example of failure becuase it results in tremedous drop in accuracy and it isnot better than randomlly guessing half of the population is infected. \n"

    "## 1. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this seems like a pretty generic workflow similar to what we are used to in class–define a generative model, get data, use data to predict optimal parameter values for the model and check the accuracy with a predefined loss function. We do not see any major standout issues. However, we do see room to question some of their design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Choice of Loss Function\n",
    "For example, we find that the author's choice of loss function does not reflect real world considerations fully. In the context of the pandemic, we would prefer a model that is more liberal in its estimates of risk because we would ideally want to err on the side of caution in the short run—we would rather isolate individuals who may not be infected, than to let individuals who are infected roam freely. In this sense, we would prefer a model with a higher false positive rate than a lower false negative rate. The loss function that is being minimized over right now does not seem to take this into account by weighing equally the risk scores for those infected and those not infected. From a practical, policy standpoint, we might want to adjust this to be more liberal in predictions. Alternatively, recognizing this feature of the model can also lead to a practical implementation where the threshold for alerting users of their close contact status is lower to compensate for the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Robustness to Model Mismatch\n",
    "This discussion continues from Experiment 4 in the previous section. In the paper, the authors tested the robustness of their model to a potential model mismatch, by using a Taylor series approximation to the generative function for calculating the probability of infection. Poorer approximations (with fewer terms) would therefore mean a greater mismatch. However, this still assumes that the underlying model is fixed and is correct, while the approximations just appear to mimic noise in the real world. We find that the authors have not sufficiently proven that the model is truly robust to model mismatches where the generative model they have assumed is almost fundamentally flawed in design to begin with. This may potentially disadvantage their model in favor of an expert-driven model, since it is less flexible to change the whole structure of the learning model and re-learn parameters, compared to an expert changing guidance on thresholds immediately in response to the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Comparison with Expert Guided Fixed Thresholds\n",
    "Another consideration we had was the author's claim that their model performs better than fixed models with expert-guided thresholds. While they did perform a comparison with the Swiss model, we are hard pressed to accept this comparison as sufficient evidence that their claim holds. For one, the data they used to test both models originated from their data generator with specific parameters. They have not provided us with enough evidence to show that the data generated is reflective of the real world (apart from the fact that the equations are based on real world physics, there is no explicit justification for the parameters used in generating data) and less that it is reflective of the situation in Switzerland, which the Swiss model was presumably being tested in. Second, since we (and the authors) did not have access to the data from the GAEN app, we can only take the author's word that the data generated from their simulation was similar enough to that collected by GAEN, that the model can be easily ported over for integration and use with GAEN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Accuracy and Uncertainty of Model\n",
    "Nonetheless, it seems promising that we are seeing the right trends in the other experiments they conducted to test their own algorithm. For example, increasing bag size and censoring probability increases the difficulty of the optimization since there is potentially more noise or less signal, and we see a corresponding decrease in accuracy. Increasing signal through increasing positive bag constructions increases accuracy to a certain point where the benefit of the increased signal is trumped by the drawbacks of noise. These experiments give us confidence that the model is being uncertain in the right conditions as we expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, further work would need to be done to properly quantify the level of uncertainty and decide if it is practical. For example, we see that the inaccuracy drops as bag size increases, but the main experiments only tested until a bag size of 32. It is unclear if this is a realistic bag size to work with for real data, especially at the height of the pandemic when a single person may have many exposure events that it presents a separate problem just deciding which exposure events go in one bag and how to aggregate risk scores across different bags meaningfully. Moreover, if an ideal bag size is larger than 32, like in the demonstration of failure mode No.2, then we know for a fact that the accuracy will drop which begs the question of whether any potential gains in accuracy over an expert determined model is significant enough to justify an ML model. If anything, the experiments definitely highlighted that a lot of the parameters (e.g. maximum bag size, maximum number of positive exposures, censoring probability) can and probably should be tuned according to what we know of the real world constraints. For example, we would want to adjust the maximum bag size to make sure that there is substantive signal from positive exposures, given the average number of positive exposures a person may receive daily, but also make sure the bag size is still realistic and efficient to run. Censoring probability in real life would also come with knowledge of take-up rates of the contact tracing app and how well people use them. Depending on that, we would have a gauge of where the model could fail and compensate or guard against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but no the least, through the failure mode No.1, we acknowledge that every algorithm has its advantages and drawbacks and some uncareful choice of parameters can result in decreasing model accuracy (increasing model uncertainty). For example, the SGD algorithm is sensitive to the learning rate, if the rate is set to be extremely low or high, the gradient search will stuck in a place or jump frantically. Other ML algorithms have issues, too, such as too easy to overfit. To conclude, the story warns us that we have to be aware of the inherited problems associated with specific alogorithm to choose in the problem. Some algorithm needs to be carefully tuned before experiments. As an extension, we actually optimize the algorithm in III.2 Future Work and Potential Modifications. \n"

    "## 2. Future Work and Potential Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Possible Modification 1: Optimization for SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the common tricks mentioned in LeCun et al.'s Backprop chapter [11], we could consider the following methods for improving the performance of the stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shuffling and Curriculum Learning.** Generally, we want to avoid providing the training examples in a meaningful, consistent order to our model as this may bias the optimization algorithm. Consequently, it is often a good idea to shuffle the training data after every epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Normalization.** To facilitate learning, we typically normalize the initial values of our parameters by initializing them with zero mean and unit variance. As training progresses and we update parameters to different extents, we lose this normalization, which slows down training and amplifies changes as the network becomes deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "  According to Ioffe and Szegedy's paper on Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift [12], batch normalization reestablishes these normalizations for every mini-batch and changes are back-propagated through the operation as well. By making normalization part of the model architecture, we are able to use higher learning rates and pay less attention to the initialization parameters. Batch normalization additionally acts as a regularizer, reducing (and sometimes even eliminating) the need for Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Early Stopping.** According to Geoff Hinton: \"Early stopping is beautiful free lunch\" (NIPS 2015 Tutorial slides, slide 63). We should thus always monitor error on a validation set during training and stop (with some patience) if our validation error does not improve enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recognize that even though these tricks have their advantages, we cannot blindly assume that their benefits hold true for all machine learning models. There is definitely room to understand our model better and see if there is even a need to be concerned about certain things, like batch normalizations, if the model was actually simple enough that the learning and update of parameters need not be complicated further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Possible Modification 2: Other Parameter Learning Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we explore specific learning methods that can enhance SGD for more efficient learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Momentum.** SGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply in one dimension than in another, which are common around local optima. In these scenarios, SGD oscillates across the slopes of the ravine while only making hesitant progress along the bottom towards the local optimum. Momentum is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction $\\gamma$ of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector: \n",
    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "\\begin{split} \n",
    "v_t &= \\gamma v_{t-1} + \\eta \\nabla_\\theta J( \\theta) \\\\ \n",
    "\\theta &= \\theta - v_t \n",
    "\\end{split} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "  This could potentially help speed up the efficiency of the SGD algorithm, though careful tuning would be needed to avoid too big a momentum such that the SGD falls into a local optimum too quickly and the algorithm terminates prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adagrad.** Adagrad is an algorithm for gradient-based optimization. It adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing smaller updates (i.e. low learning rates) for parameters associated with frequently occurring features, and larger updates (i.e. high learning rates) for parameters associated with infrequent features. For this reason, it is well-suited to dealing with sparse data. Dean et al. found in their paper, Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks [13], that Adagrad greatly improved the robustness of SGD and used it for training large-scale neural nets at Google, which—among other things—learned to recognize cats in YouTube videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In its update rule, Adagrad modifies the general learning rate $\\eta$ at each time step $t$ for every parameter $\\theta_i$ based on the past gradients that have been computed for $\\theta_i$:\n",
    "$$\\theta_{t+1, i} = \\theta_{t, i} - \\dfrac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{G_{t, ii} + \\epsilon}} \\cdot g_{t, i}$$\n",
    "\\\n",
    "$G_{t, ii}$ here is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element $i$, $i$ is the sum of the squares of the gradients w.r.t. $\\theta_i$ up to time step $t$, while $\\epsilon$ is a smoothing term that avoids division by zero (usually on the order of 1e−8).\n",
    "\n",
    "  While this method may have its benefits, for our particular model, it may not be completely relevant since we are not exactly working with sparse data (and also assume that our data is complete, save for the censoring). Nonetheless, in a real world setting, as the authors of our paper have mentioned, it is likely that the contact tracing app may miss picking up on a lot of exposure events. Hence, the problem may be reformulated to be one of determining risk score with sparse data, and this method may come in handy then.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adadelta.** Adadelta is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size $w$. With Adadelta, we do not even need to set a default learning rate, as it has been eliminated from the update rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adam.** Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is another method that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. In addition to storing an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients $v_t$ like Adadelta, Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients $m_t$, similar to momentum. Whereas momentum can be seen as a ball running down a slope, Adam behaves like a heavy ball with friction, which thus prefers flat minima in the error surface. We compute the decaying averages of past and past squared gradients $m_t$ and $v_t$ respectively as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "\\begin{split} \n",
    "m_t &= \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_1) g_t \\\\ \n",
    "v_t &= \\beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_2) g_t^2 \n",
    "\\end{split} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, it is a balance we need to strike between overcomplicating the model and optimizing methods for greater efficiency.\n",

    "+ **The Tracing App**\n",
    "\n",
    "The world has been fighting COVID-19 for two years. From a perspective, we have witnessed how technological advances could aid in preventing the spread of the virus. The covid tracing app is an innovative example that benefits lots of people. Each terminal user who agrees to share information with the platform can get timely feedback from the app about the risk of infection. For larger parties like medical providers who need to monitor close contacts or relevant public agencies that need to enact policies, the existence of a tracing app saves time from endless searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to obtain great accuracy for risk score modeling since it will provide more helpful information and saves time. The inacurrate contact tracing, on the contrary, will falsely occupy the medical resources greatly. As we mentioned before, one of the main contributions from original authors is to build off the model from real-world, bio-medically sound laws. With more realistic constraints considered, the original authors' parameters are more helpful in improving the tracing content. As for us, we manage to replicate their approach for optimizing the risk score model parameters and experiment with more optimization methods on top of their data management and fundamental SGD algorithm. We hope that we have made positive impacts throughout the process and contributed to smoother future iterations of this application.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **The Inspiration for ML Community**\n",
    "\n",
    "The successful application for using machine learning technologies on covid-19 risk score modeling could give confidence to the ML community and encourage engineers/scientists to explore more. Essentially, we provide several possible modifications and enhancements that can be applied to the original learning algorithm. It shows that others are incentivized to improve the performance based on a good starting point (the original work done by paper authors). Combining with the background of the study, we incentivize more ML engineers to contribute to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the work could have broadened the community’s perspective on what ML can achieve. Now it is only an example for making an accurate covid tracing app. Still, in the future, the procedure can be used for other infectious diseases or be prepared for future public health events. Other fields are possible, too, since we have shown the capability of ML to model some real-life scenarios with actual physical law captured. All in all, we can propose a bright future for ML applications, but there are caveats that we have to be careful about as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Privacy Issue in Data Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between data privacy and prediction accuracy has bothered data scientists for a long time. In the original work and our replicated version, we use simulated data for exposure events and interactions between human users. However, companies in the real world will finally adopt the tracing app and similar applications, and they will feed in real data. It could eventually become a privacy issue, and such an issue has already shown its lousy influence in some countries. In China, the government strictly controls the covid cases, and the media will keep publishing the case information over the internet (Weibo, Weixin official account, etc.). Several internet violence events have happened: a young lady from Chengdu has been reported as PCR test positive, and then not only her itineraries, but also her name, ID number, family background were extensively searched for and reported on the internet. The impact is detrimental for her and further warns us of the problem of using real data in public health scenarios. \n",
    " \n",
    "It seems that maybe the higher-level administrators must come up with a legislative solution to improve the situation. Meanwhile, for our end, as engineers and data scientists, we recommend adding privacy filters onto the dataset manually. We could incorporate methods for the de-identification process, such as suppressing, adding synthetic records, or applying a differential privacy algorithm. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, when manipulating de-identification on the dataset, we potentially result in some level of inaccuracy. One aspect is misrepresentation associated with a biased and distorted dataset. Like in crime analysis, misrepresentation and underrepresentation cause a big problem of prioritizing some races. The other aspect is information loss. In this specific scenario of the covid tracing app, using too much de-identification processing harms the integrity of information, which is one of the bedrocks that we want to base on improving the algorithm. Moreover, we are alternatively creating more censorship, potentially increasing the learning complexity for machines. \n",
    " \n",
    "Although we have a good intention of protecting privacy while using public data by some means, we shall think of the consequences. Our goal of contributing to the world needs to be reassessed with the abovementioned ethical issues in a delicate balance. In conclusion, albeit no more action we could take during this step of the project, we urge researchers to be aware of the tradeoff of data privacy and data accuracy and incorporate methods to mitigate the problem.\n"
